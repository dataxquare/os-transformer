This is an example of how we can create our own `ChatGPT`.

We are doing this by creating a generative model that is trained with the data from a text file.

## How to run

1. Install `poetry` from https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation
2. Run `poetry install`

As the training of a transformer is very computationally expensive, we recommend to use a GPU in cloud to train the model.

We have take as an example this repository: https://github.com/karpathy/ng-video-lecture/ who was made by the VP of engineering os Tesla
